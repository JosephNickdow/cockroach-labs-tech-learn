To run the slides you need to install Node Server:

- MAC: 
	- `brew install node`
	- `npm install -g http-server`

- execute `./run.sh` (starts Node Server) (in terminal you should see an "available on: http://...." local URL that you can enter into Chrome) 
- open `index.html` in Chrome for best rendering 
- press `S` to see speakers notes for each slide
